Flower classification using decision tree classifier

In this model I have used Decision tree classifier from sklearn using 'entropy' split criterion.

Dataset Description:
Here Iris Dataset is used from sklearn.datasets.
The dataset contains a total of 150 instances (samples).
There are four features (attributes) in the dataset, which are measurements of different parts of iris flowers:
1. Sepal length (in centimeters)
2. Sepal width (in centimeters)
3. Petal length (in centimeters)
4. Petal width (in centimeters)

There are three classes in the iris dataset:
1. Setosa: Class level = 0
2. Versicolor: Class level = 1
3. Virginica: Class level = 2

The Iris dataset is publicly available and can be easily accessed through libraries like scikit-learn, or you can find it in various machine learning datasets repositories.
